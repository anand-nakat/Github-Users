# Github Users

Github Users is a Web Application which uses Github API to provide a summary about a Github User, like number of Repositories owned by the User, number of Followers, Gists created, etc. So just type in the Github username to get a Quick Summary.

It uses Fusion Charts to represent more info like Most Used Languages by the User, Most Starred Repositories, Most Forked Repositories in the form of Charts.
